- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mpmackd
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, web design, and command line for Linux, PowerShell, and CMD.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my way around Linux (Ubuntu). I just want to be able to write simple code, test software, and ultimately... create an Android app that is simple, yet useful. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn where the hell to start when it comes to learning to code!  There's so much to learn! How do I design an app for Android that will allow the user to fill out a simple contact form, build a database to store that info, be able to easily review the user's info, then send a message back to the application to the user. 
- 👨‍💼 I am a Recruiter, consultant, and Staffing Agent. I'm still looking full time, however, I just formed my own Corporation which I would like to spend more time developing. It is a Consulting business design to help people or underemployed reach your career goals, as well as helping businesses identify areas of growth, Target areas that need changing, and increase efficiency throughout the clients organization.My goal is to learn to code and create a better looking website, a database for users, and a functional app that they can use to easily utilize my services.
